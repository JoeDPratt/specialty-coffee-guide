<p>Wogan Coffee's Indonesia Sumatra Mandheling is a distinguished single-origin coffee that stands out for its deep, robust flavor profile and meticulous production process. Sourced from the Permata Gayo co-operative in Sumatra's Aceh Province, this coffee is cultivated at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 1,600 meters, utilizing the unique Giling-Basah processing method.</p>
<h3>Flavor Profile and Roast</h3>
<p>This offering is Wogan Coffee's darkest roast, taken through the beginning of the second crack to achieve a smoky, intense flavor. Despite its boldness, it maintains nuanced notes of red berries and dark chocolate, providing a complex and satisfying cup.</p>
<h3>Processing Method</h3>
<p>The Giling-Basah, or wet-hulled process, is distinctive to Indonesia. It involves drying the green coffee beans to three different levels of humidity as they are transported down the mountain. This method imparts a slightly blue hue to the raw beans and contributes to the coffee's full-bodied, low-acidity profile.</p>
<h3>Certifications and Sustainability</h3>
<p>This coffee is both Organic and Fairtrade certified, reflecting Wogan Coffee's commitment to ethical sourcing and environmental sustainability. The Permata Gayo co-operative, established in 2006, emphasizes traceability and quality, managing all aspects of production to ensure consistency and excellence.</p>
